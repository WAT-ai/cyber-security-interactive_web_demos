    <p><span>Our team has been trying to detect hackers&rsquo; network activity on smart devices.
        This is difficult because smart devices like Amazon Alexas or security cameras are usually powered by small
        microcontrollers. Thus, it&rsquo;s impossible to run intensive software on them. </span></p>
    <p><span></span></p>
    <p><span>Even worse, we&rsquo;ve been working with the

        <span><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/madhavmalhotra/unb-cic-iot-dataset/data"><b>
              Canadian Institute of Cybersecurity&rsquo;s IoT 2023 dataset</b></a></span><span>, which has over 14 GB of
          data! Clearly, we can&rsquo;t store (yet
          alone train algorithms on) all this data on a small smart device. Thus, we have some tricky design
          requirements in creating ways to detect hackers:</span></p>
    <ol start="1">
      <li><span>We had to very carefully find the best statistics about
          hackers&rsquo; network requests and use only that minimal information. Ex: We want to know if the hacker
          has a web request, but not down to nitty gritty details like whether HTTP or HTTPS protocols are used.
        </span></li>
      <li><span>We needed an algorithm that we could train on a massive dataset
          in the cloud. The aim is to store the algorithm on a microcontroller without taking up much space. This
          is like the &lsquo;knowledge&rsquo; from the gigabytes of data is &lsquo;distilled&rsquo; into a much
          smaller format.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p><span></span></p>
    <p><span>Given this context, there are a few unsupervised learning AI algorithms that can meet
        our needs. This is where the negative selection and K-means algorithms come in. </span></p>
    <p><span></span></p>
    <h2><b>Explaining the Negative Selection Algorithm</b></h2>
    <p><span></span></p>
    <p><span>This is the general approach that our group followed, with various side algorithms to
        help. Negative selection involves trying to detect patterns about what normal network requests look like. If
        a new network request comes in that&rsquo;s too different from detected patterns, we know it&rsquo;s
        abnormal (from a hacker). </span></p>
    <img id="neg-selec-img" src="./media/negative_selection_diagram.png" alt="Negative selection algorithm">
    <p><span>This sounds good in theory, but the hard part is generating those
        &lsquo;patterns.&rsquo; The naive approach that the negative selection algorithm tries is to simply generate
        random numbers until those random numbers resemble statistics about normal network requests in our dataset.
        This takes a long time. So we used a more efficient alternative: K-means selection.</span></p>
    <p><span></span></p>
    <h2><b>Using K-means to Find Centroids</b></h2>
    <p><span></span></p>
    <p><span>K-means is a clustering algorithm which groups datapoints into clusters. In this
        case, we are clustering benign data (normal network requests) into K groups. The centre of each cluster
        (each &lsquo;centroid&rsquo;) will be a &lsquo;pattern&rsquo; of normal network requests for the negative
        selection algorithm.</span></p>
    <p><span></span></p>
    <p><span>To start, we create centroids with random values. Based on this random assignment,
        each data point will be grouped into a cluster based on which centroid each data point is closest to. We
        measure &lsquo;closeness&rsquo; (AKA affinity) with the </span><span><a

    </div>
    <p><span></span></p>
    <p><span>After this initial start, we loop two main steps. </span></p>
    <ol start="1">
      <li><span>Centroids have their values randomly reset if they are &lsquo;not
          close to any data&rsquo; (no datapoints were grouped into that centroid). &nbsp;</span></li>
      <li><span>What about centroids that did have datapoints grouped under them?
          We set these centroids&rsquo; values to be the average of the datapoints grouped under them. Ie. These
          centroids become more like the data they represent.</span></li>
    </ol>

    <p><span>Usually, the algorithm stops looping when the centroid values are no longer changing
        much. As seen above though, the centroid values are very volatile. This is because the data isn&rsquo;t
        &lsquo;normalized&rsquo;.</span></p>
    <p><span></span></p>
    <h2><b>Normalizing the Data to Improve Convergence</b></h2>
    <p><span>&lsquo;Normalized&rsquo; data is data where all values have a mean of 0 and a
        standard deviation of one. This makes all values very similar, which helps with computing the averages and
        distances described in the k-means algorithm. </span></p>
    <p><span></span></p>
    <p><span>Our original dataset is far from normalized. For example, it includes a network
        request duration statistic, often in thousands of milliseconds. However, it also includes a 0/1 value to
        indicate if the network request used the TCP protocol. Clearly, the network request duration statistic will
        dominate any averages/distances calculated. </span></p>
    <p><span></span></p>
    <p><span>To convert the original data into normalized data, we use a formula from Statistics
        101: </span><span><a
